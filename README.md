# Advent Of Code

This repository contains all my solutions to the adventOfCode challenges.

If you're not familiar with it, I highly recommend checking out their website as they offer some exciting algorithmic problems.

## Launching scripts

Each script corresponds to a specific challenge and can be launched independently.

To get started :

1. Login or sign in to the AoC platform
2. Save your session cookie in a file name ***.session-cookie*** at the root of the project
3. Run the script using the following command :

```bash
python ./2022/chall10.py
```

4. The result will be displayed in your terminal
